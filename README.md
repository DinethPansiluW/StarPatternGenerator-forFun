# Star Pattern Generator

## [Live Demo](https://dinethpansiluw.github.io/Star-Pattern-Generator/)

A simple web application that generates a right-angled triangle star pattern based on user input. The user can specify the number of rows, and the application dynamically creates a pattern of stars accordingly.

## Features:
- **Real-time input processing**: The star pattern updates as you type the number of rows.
- **Lightweight and easy-to-understand code**: Ideal for beginners learning JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
- **Interactive**: Adjust the number and instantly see a custom star pattern.

## How it Works:
1. **Enter a number** in the input field to specify how many rows the pattern should have.
2. The app displays a right-angled triangle star pattern with that many rows.
3. As you modify the number, the pattern updates instantly.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML** - Structure of the page
- **JavaScript** - Logic to generate the star pattern and handle DOM updates

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Start entering numbers into the input field to generate the star pattern.

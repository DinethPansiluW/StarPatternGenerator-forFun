- **Interactive**: Adjust the number and instantly see a custom star pattern.

## How it Works:
1. **Enter a number** in the input field to specify how many rows the pattern should have.
2. The app displays a right-angled triangle star pattern with that many rows.
3. As you modify the number, the pattern updates instantly.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML** - Structure of the page
- **JavaScript** - Logic to generate the star pattern and handle DOM updates
